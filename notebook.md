# Inputs

Inputs are on of the key topics in NNFS book. First we have used to pass to neurons only one set of inputs. To get better output from the neural network it needs to be used batch of inputs which is called **samples**. 

These **samples** contains multiple input sets for that layer of neurons. These samples are then calculated at the same weights. This helps to adjust correctly the network

# Weight and bias initialization

Random initialization can be used when creating neurons to the network and this proach has been used on this course too. 

But for reminding there can be used pre trained values for network as it does not start from scratch or there could be generated some rules for creating those numbers. More about this can be found from **dense layer class** section in nnfs book (page 66->).
